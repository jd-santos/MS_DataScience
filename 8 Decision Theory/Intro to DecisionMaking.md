Intro to Decision Making

- We typically aren’t schooled on making decisions 

### Perspectives on Decision Making
- Normative/Prescriptive
	- Specifies how decisions should be made in a rational or economic sense
	- Assumes people have perfect information, can specify their preferences clearly and consistently, generate alternatives, optimize solutions, aren’t inconsistent or subject to errors in reason or judgement 
- Behavioral/Descriptive
	- How decisions are actually made
	- Assume most of the above assumptions aren’t true to varying degrees 
	- 
### Problems and Bottlenecks 
- We tend to believe information or data and experience lead to perfect decisions
- Common bottlenecks:
	- Human cognitive information processing 
	- Too little or unreliable data
	- Too much data
		- Requires data infrastructure
	- Bad models
	- Bad use of good models
	- Faulty judgement, reasoning, or decision making 

### Defining Decision making
- Decision making can be thought of as a point in time or a process
	- We will focus on process

> The fact is, decision making is not an event. It’s a process, one that unfolds over weeks, months, or even years.\
\

> — Garvin and Roberto, p.1. 

### Keys to Good Decision Making
- Training
	- Awareness, processes, and tools
- Preparation
	- Collect data and experience using appropriate methods and receiving feedback from the environment
- Practice
	- Acquire skill and expertise 
- Outcomes
	- Not always in our control due to our own actions
	- What we mainly control is the **process**
	- Success = Talent + Luck
	- Daniel Kahneman: Great success = a little more talent + a lot of luck

### Process Model of Decision Making
- Show the steps that should be taken in an ideal situation
- Often the time needed to perform every step will be lacking
	- These models are the *upper bound* or best practice of how decisions should be made
