# Master of Science in Data Science, Texas Tech University

These are my notes, projects, and assignments from the [MS Data Science program](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/rawlsbusiness/graduate/ms/datascience/) at Texas Tech's Rawls College of Business.

## Classes
You can refer to the [course schedule] on TTU's website to follow along in the coursework. Classes and material will be added as I progress through the program.

Courses so far:
- Statistics for Data Science
  - An introduction to statistical concepts as well as the R language
- Scripting Languages
  - An introduction of software development intended for data analytics
  - This course uses Python with Pandas and NumPy, but is careful to focus on conceptual information rather than technical specifics

## Formats
Most of descriptive content is in markdown or Jupyter Notebooks, the Statistics course makes heavy use of R-Markdown which is best viewed in an R IDE to run the code chunks.

Time permitting I will likely convert all of the Python and R material to ipynb. 

## Cheatsheets
These are my references that I update with useful snippets I've learned that assist my workflow, they aren't necessarily taught in class.
TeX, for example, is not a part of the curriculum but I've found it extremely useful for capturing formulas so I can stay in markdown/notebooks.
