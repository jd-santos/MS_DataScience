# Master of Science in Data Science, Texas Tech University

These are my notes, projects, and assignments from the [MS Data Science program](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/rawlsbusiness/graduate/ms/datascience/) at Texas Tech's Rawls College of Business.

## Classes
You can refer to the [course schedule](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/rawlsbusiness/graduate/ms/datascience/schedule.php) on TTU's website to follow along in the coursework. Classes and material will be added as I progress through the program.

Courses so far:
-	Business Intelligence
	-	Really smart narrow focus on ETLs in Pentaho, Python web scraping, and visualization in Tableau
-	Time Series Analysis
	- I don't know what Econometrics means yet but it sounds cool 
- Statistics for Data Science
  - An introduction to statistical concepts as well as the R language
- Scripting Languages
  - An introduction of software development intended for data analytics
  - This course uses Python with Pandas and NumPy, but is careful to focus on conceptual information rather than technical specifics

  
## Repo organization

### Lecture Notes
The top directory in each class will be the course lecture notes, including example code. Most of the time I am rewriting lecture presentation content and professor-provided code chunks as my own learning method, but sometimes I fall into transcribing mode for the lecture slide decks.

It's a fast program, I'm doing my best.

For that reason I do not present these notes as my own work, but neither do I include any lecture slideshows given directly by the instructors. At worst I screenshot the particularly juicy diagrams.  Otherwise these markdown files were lovingly typed by hand into [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), my favorite Markdown editor.

### Projects and Assignments
These items will always be my work, with the exception of code included as part of the assignment and group projects. Often I try to include some headmatter to explain the task or prompt I am responding to. Feel free to file an issue if you find somewhere where this is not the case. 

### Readings, etc.
Extra content provided by the professor or dug up by me while doing background research. May be in a variety of file types. Hopefully nothing copyrighted, most of these should be from public sources. 

## Formats
Most of descriptive content is in markdown or Jupyter Notebooks, the Statistics course makes heavy use of R-Markdown which is best viewed in an R IDE to run the code chunks.

Time permitting I will likely convert all of the Python and R material to ipynb. 

## Cheatsheets
These are my references that I update with useful snippets I've learned that assist my workflow, they aren't necessarily taught in class.
TeX, for example, is not a part of the curriculum but I've found it extremely useful for capturing formulas so I can stay in markdown/notebooks.
