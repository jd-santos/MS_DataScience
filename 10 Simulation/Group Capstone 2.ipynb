    "Ryan Miller, either the founder or the CEO of CommuniCorp, is stressed about the financials of his business. CommuniCorp, the manufacturer of pagers, stocks plummeted within the last 12 months, losing about 25% of the pager market. The ticker price is also at an all-time low in the previous 52 weeks. Mr. Miller found that it was due to the lack of transparency and communication between the marketing and warehouse executives.\n",

    "c) The reason why the answer differs between the two methods is that they have different planning horizons. The first method in part (a) involves Emily evaluating the number and type of servers to purchase on a monthly basis, resulting in separate decisions for each month. However, this approach leads to a suboptimal solution as it doesn't consider potential cost savings or capacity requirements for the entire planning period. On the other hand, the second method in part (b) involves Emily evaluating the number and type of servers to purchase over the entire planning period. This approach allows her to make better-informed decisions that minimize the total cost while meeting the capacity requirements for all departments over the entire timeline."
