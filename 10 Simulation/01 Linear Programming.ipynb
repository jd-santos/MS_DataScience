    "## Elements of Linear Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Programming is one of the simpler class optimization models. Specifically it is a form of constrained optimization, where we attempt to find the best point of a function while respecting various constraints. In the real world, these constraints are usually related to limited resources that we are trying to optimize around.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four elements of a constrained optimization problem:\n",
    "- Decision variables\n",
    "    - The unknown values you're trying to determine\n",
    "    - Can be thought of as different quantities of a product to produce, amount of money to spend on different options, etc.\n",
    "- The objective function\n",
    "    - The mathematical expression that combines the decision variables to express our goal\n",
    "    - We are trying to either minimize (e.g. an expense) or maximize (e.g. profit) this function\n",
    "- Constraints\n",
    "    - The mathematical expression representing limitations, requirements, or restrictions imposed on our solution\n",
    "- Variable bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Building our optimization model requires us to identify these components and create mathematical expressions out of our objective function and constraints, which are linear functions of the decision variables. All variables are continuous, if a variable is required to take an integer value then this requires the use of *integer programming.* No you can't just use LP and round up to an integer, your results may not be optimal, and you will feel bad.\n"

    "Up until now we have focused on finding the optimal solution, which is a useful first step. However, we can look more closely at our decision variables to see how they contribute to that solution and what happens if any are changed. There are a few terms that are important to this type of analysis:\n",

    "**Binding constraints**: These are constraints that would directly affect the optimal solution if changed as they limit the feasible region. Binding constraints have zero slack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slack**: The slack of a constraint is the difference between the right-hand side (RHS) and left-hand side (LHS) of the constraint equation at the optimal solution. This tells us the amount of unused capacity for a given constraint. If the slack is greater than zero, the constraint is non-binding and is not limiting the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shadow price**: For a binding constraint, the shadow price represents how much the objective value will change when the RHS of the constraint changes. \n",
    "- This is essentially the marginal value of the constraint, as it affects the value of the objective function per unit of increase (in a binding constraint in a maximization problem)\n",
    "- The shadow price is zero for non-binding constraints, we can consider these resources to be in surplus (or \"free goods\" if you're an economist, but we don't care about them) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduced cost**: It's possible for the optimum solution for variables to be zero. As an example, it may not be as profitable to produce any of Product A and focus entirely on Product B. Reduced cost helps us determine what would need to change about that variable in order for it to make the cut of our optimal solution.\n",
    "- Specifically, it tells us how much the coefficient of that variable in the objective function needs to increase for maximization problems, or decrease for minimization problems, in order to be part of the optimal solution.\n",
    "- If in our example objective function $Z = 50x_1 + 40x_2$ we found that the optimal solution was to have zero units of $x_2$ (Product B), a reduced cost of 10 would mean that the coefficient of $x_2$ would need to increase from 40 to 50 for it to be greater than zero in our optimal solution.

    "It makes sense that increasing our overall investment would give us a greater return, but our model design doesn't actually reflect the real-world marginal value of increasing the overall investment. Our constraints, which were given to us as percentages, were converted to values relative to the $500,000 investment. This is a good example of why thoughtful model design is important, because assumptions baked into the model can limit the utility of its outputs."
