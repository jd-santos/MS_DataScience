    "a) Using the techniques discussed in the input-analysis lecture, recommend an input distribution model for the \"FailCount,\" \"RepairTime,\" and \"DriveTime\" variables. Also, determine the distributions' parameters (For example, if data is Normal, what is the approximate mean and stdev; or if the data is Uniform, what are the minimum and maximum parameters).\n",

    "b) We pay \\\\$2 per minute (\\\\$120 per hour) to the technician who fixes a wind turbine, and the payment includes DriveTime and RepairTime multiplied by the total number of failures. Use the distribution and parameters you determined through input analysis (in part a) to simulate the total income of the technician per year. Report histogram, mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval.\n",
