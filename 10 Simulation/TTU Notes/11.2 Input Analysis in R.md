# Using a Fitted Distribution for Monte Carlo Simulation

When performing a simulation study, there is no substitution for actually observing the
system and collecting the data required for the modeling effort.

Input modeling begins with data collection, probability, statistics, and analysis.

A typical input modeling process includes the following procedures:

1. Determine whether your data is discrete or continuous.

2. Visualize the data: Check the histogram, plot a time series plot, and make an autocorrelation plot of the data. Check if the week, period, or day of week influence the statistical properties of the count data.

3. Hypothesizing distributions. Fortunately, R has a very useful package for fitting a wide variety of discrete and continuous distributions call the fitdistrplus package.

4. Estimating parameters.

5. Checking goodness of fit for hypothesized distributions.


**Example** In the newsvendor model, suppose we have a histrocal data for demand. We are interested to know what distribution can we fit for this data.

```{r}
data = read.csv("http://tiny.cc/histDemand")

# 1. Data is discrete.

# 2. visualize data

hist(data$Sales, main="Historical Demand")
# The distribution of the data is positively (right) skewed and unimodal.

plot(data$Sales, type="b", main="Historical Demand", ylab = "Count", xlab = "Each Year")
# There is no noticable trend in the time-series plot

acf(data$Sales, main = "ACF Plot for Demand") # Auto-correlation plot
#the autocorrelation plot shows no significant correlation with respect to observation number (all lags are well within the confidence band). Therefore, the data appears to be stationary (IID). 

# 3. Hypothesizing distributions.
library(fitdistrplus)
descdist(data$Sales, discrete = TRUE)

# Let's try Poisson
fit.nbinom = fitdist(data$Sales, "nbinom")
summary(fit.nbinom)
fit.pois = fitdist(data$Sales, "pois")
summary(fit.pois)
gofstat(fit.pois)
# H0: Data is distributed by Poisson distribution
# Test is rejected. p-value < 0.05
# Therefore, it's better to try to fit continuous distributions, otherwise use resampling (sampling with replacement) for simulation
```

Let's try continuous distributions:

The kurtosis and squared skewness of your sample is plotted as a blue point named "Observation". It seems that possible distributions include the Gamma Weibull and possibly the Normal distribution.

```{r}

# If we assume data is continuous.
library(fitdistrplus)
descdist(data$Sales, discrete = FALSE)

fit.gamma <- fitdist(data$Sales, "gamma")
summary(fit.gamma)

fit.weibull <- fitdist(data$Sales, "weibull")
summary(fit.weibull)

fit.norm <- fitdist(data$Sales, "norm")
summary(fit.norm)

# So far Gamma has the best log-likelihood. 

plot(fit.gamma)

plot(fit.weibull)

plot(fit.norm)

```

Both Gamma and Normall look good.

```{r}
fit.gamma$loglik

fit.norm$loglik
```

In our example, we pick Gamma distribution. 

```{r}
summary(fit.gamma)

```

The we produce [Gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution) random numbers for our model.

```{r}
# Let's solve the newsVendor model again, this time we assume demand is distributed by gamma distribution.
# Data
R = 18  # Selling price
C = 12  # Cost
S = 9   # Discount Price
# Model
netProfitFun = function(D, Q, R, S, C){
  R*min(D,Q) + S * max(0, Q-D) - C*Q
}

num_sim = 1000

Qrange = 40:50

sim_D = rgamma(num_sim, shape = 295.63, rate = 6.71)

profitMatrix <- matrix(0, nrow = num_sim, ncol = length(Qrange))

j = 0
for (Q in Qrange) {
  j = j+1
  for (i in 1:num_sim) {
    profitMatrix[i, j] = netProfitFun(sim_D[i], Q, R, S, C)  
  }
}

# Expected profit for each Q
colMeans(profitMatrix)

plot(Qrange, colMeans(profitMatrix), ylab = "Expected Profit", xlab = "Q")

# Q* = 45

```

## Class Practice

The observations available in the file represent the count of the number of failures on a windmill turbine farm per year. Using the techniques discussed today, recommend an input distribution model for this situation.

```{r}
numFailure <- read.csv("http://tiny.cc/numFailure")
numFailure <- numFailure$failure

hist(numFailure)

plot(numFailure, type = "b")
# There is no trend. 

acf(numFailure)
# Data is stationary

library(fitdistrplus)
descdist(numFailure, discrete = TRUE)

fit.pois = fitdist(numFailure, "pois")
summary(fit.pois)
fit.nbinom = fitdist(numFailure, "nbinom")
summary(fit.nbinom)
# I go with Negative Binomial, which it has larger log-likelihood.
gofstat(fit.nbinom)

# P-value is larger than 0.05, Negative binomial is a good fit with size=8.071, mu = 3.099

num_sim = 10
rnbinom(num_sim, size=8.071, mu = 3.099)

```
