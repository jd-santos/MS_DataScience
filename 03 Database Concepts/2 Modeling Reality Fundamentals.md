# 2 Modeling Reality Fundamentals
## Models Overview
- Models are used to better represent reality in a database
- Three levels of modeling reality: conceptual, logical, physical
	- We will start with logical models which includes the components of conceptual models that matter for our purposes
	- Logical modeling techniques
		- Entity-Relationship Modeling
			- Used primarily for online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
		- Dimensional Modeling
			- Used for Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems
- Normalization
	- Splitting entities into separate tables to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity
	- Described as forms, normal forms are not discussed here but are covered in reference material
- Data Redundancy 
	- The storage of the same data multiple times
	- E.g. storing a customer’s email individually on every order
	- Can lead to loss of data integrity
- Data integrity
	- Consistency of data in a database
	- Inconsistency arises due to certain avoidable modification anomalies
## Logical Model Building Blocks
- Entities 
	- Things in reality we want to keep data about, usually expressed as nouns 
	- It is a representation of a thing or concept
	- E.g. products, customers, employees
- Attributes
	- Characteristics or property of entity for which you want to store data
	- Key attributes
		- Uniquely identifies instances of an entity
		- Instances identify something specific that occurs in reality, we need to be able to capture and uniquely identify that occurrence 
		- **Candidate keys**
			- Any set of attributes that could be chosen as a key of an entity
		- **Primary key**
			- The candidate key designated for principal use in uniquely identifying instances of an entity
			- **Composite key**
				- A primary key consisting of one or more attributes
			- **Surrogate key**
				- Artificial attribute added to an entity to serve as the primary key
		- **Alternate key**
			- A candidate key not designated as primary key
		- **Foreign key**
			- An attribute in one entity that constitutes a key in some other (possibly the same) entity
			- Used to indicate logical links between entities 
- Relationships
	- Logical link between entities, often stated as verbs
	- Shows how entities are related
	- **Cardinality**
		- The number of instances of one entity related to a single instance of another entity 
		- **Minimum cardinality**
			- The minimum number of entities that **must** participate in a relationship instance
			- Tells us if either side’s participation is optional or mandatory
		- **Maximum cardinality** 
			- The maximum number of entity instances that **can** participate in a relationship instance 
			- Specifies what is possible in terms of how many entity instances can be related to another entity instance
## Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
- Purpose and scope
	- Define the purpose (of the database) and the scope (of reality) you are modeling
- Entities
	- The things in reality we want to capture and store data about
	- Drawn in rectangles and labeled as nouns
- Attributes
	- Added in the entity rectangles
	- Select one or more of the candidate keys to act as the primary key
- Relationships
	- Determine how the entities are related
	- Draw lines between them to signify the relationships and label them
	- Cardinality
		- Showing whether a relationship is one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many
		- This step is where you’ll specify the foreign keys in entities, typically on the ‘many’ side of a relationship
