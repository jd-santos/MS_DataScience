# 8 Privacy and Ethics
## Privacy
- Concerns about ownership and use of data are growing as more personal data are transmitted and stored online
- Two major issues:
	- Who owns the data?
	- Who controls the data?
- Some laws like the GDPR exists around data privacy, but most issues around privacy are still being debated
	- Europe instituted the “right to be forgotten” which forces companies to remove data a person no longer wants public
	- It’s not easy to operationalize
- The US is generally lacking in a coherent policy towards data privacy 
	- Probably won’t change until there is widespread public outrage
	- Corporations, rather than individuals, are likely to retain the upper hand
- US surveys show that the majority of people believe that online information needs more protection
	- But they don’t favor government regulation to accomplish that
- Walker (Big Data Big Profits) distinguishes between actively and passively collected data 
	- Does the distinction matter?
	- Walker argues users should own actively shared data but passive is unclear 
- Personal Data Exchanges
	- Created by some firms where people can actively sell their data to third parties
	- However large firms like Google and Facebook are collecting the data for free
- There are moral and operational reasons for suppliers to care about privacy
	- Additionally, there are personal and risk-related reasons to be concerned from the consumer side
### Data Management Risk
- There is an operational risk of managing data
- Stolen data often results in large fines, but many firms aren’t equipped to protect the data 
	- Or they just haven’t been careful (Equifax) 
- Data breaches suggest a need to increase incentives for businesses to protect data
	- Otherwise they will be seen as a cost of doing business 
## Ethics
- If a firm has explicit consent to capture someone’s data, for what purpose can it be used?
	- Good example: fighting fraud
	- Ok example: targeted advertising
	- Scary example: selling information to health insurance companies to change coverage
		- Is selling data at all ethical?
- If a firm has no consent to capture someone’s data, then what is ethical?
- With consent, there are still ethical questions
	- Should personal data be turned over to law enforcement agencies?
		- With/without probable cause?
		- Reasonable suspicion? 
		- Warrant?
		- Are there 4th amendment protections? 
	- Are data custodians required to censor speech or opinions?
		- Or required to collect data on “dangerous” people
		- Should they be subject to the 1st amendment? 
- Slippery slope problem
	- Even if firms gather information for initially legit purposes, they will be tempted to monetize it 
	- From Jennifer Lynch at the EFF:
> It’s a very small leap from using data to detect fraud to using them to learn very private information about you
