# 5 Monetizing Big Data
## Overview
- Information alone rarely has economic value, but it might have intellectual value that eventually creates economic value
- Information has to be transformed to address a particular economic need to be valuable
## Monetization Strategies
### Keep the data proprietary
- E.g. Using data to improve internal operations and reduce costs, improve ROI, better employee satisfaction, etc
- Airlines measuring several things electronically: bags, tickets, passengers to forecast demand for seats, find lost luggage more quickly, etc 
- Using data to envision and launch new products
	- Requires strategic data capture and imagination
- License the data exclusively
	- Either to a single company or one company per industry
	- Example: companies that capture driving information
		- Can be sold to insurance companies for rates, or auto companies for product development
- Examples
	- Fitbit
		- Collects data about people's health with wearables
		- With permission it could share this data to insurance companies or workplaces
	- Google
		- Used search engine info to launch Google Maps
	- Amazon

### Sell the Data product
