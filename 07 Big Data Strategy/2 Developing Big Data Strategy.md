2 Developing Big Data Strategy
## Strategic Characteristics
### Scale
- Scale of big data is vast
	- Terabytes and petabytes
- Sometimes sampling is no longer necessary
	- N = All
	- Might still have sampling if data is expensive or onerous to gather
- Can reduce complexity
	- Compete data can be easily stored and manipulated in one location
	- Less need for redundancy
	- Noise also reduced
- Greater economic value
	- More info *usually* means better decisions
- Risk reduction with more complete information
- Improve resource allocations
	- More information gives more optimal use of resources
### Velocity
- How fast data is available 
- Nearly "real-time"
	- Millisecond-by-millisecond
	- Changes the opportunities about the ability to make choices
- Large amounts of data quickly overwhelms how quickly fleshbodies can process it 
- Allows us access to information at the crucial moments to make sales
	- Best Buy ‘showrooming’ where customers would order from other retailers on their phones in-store
- Value proposition
	- Decreased search costs
	- Faster responses and efficiently processing only current data
	- More informed choices and better decisionmaking
- Examples
	- Nordstrom at the POS can check for out of stock inventory in nearby stores and have it sent over for pickup
	- Real-time availability of airline tickets, seats, and various other data has essentially eliminated travel agents 
### With Their Powers Combined
- Precision of larger samples/population in scale  combined with velocity allows for some business witchcraft:
	- The ability to customize immediately (or quickly)
	- Responding quickly to opportunities and changing market conditions  
- This is the ~strategic promise~ of big data
## Developing Big Data Strategy
### Initial questions
- How does big data fit into your business?
- What is the company trying to achieve?
### What Big Data Can Achieve
- Cost reductions
	- E.g. Hadoop reducing data storage costs 
- Time reductions
	- Cycle time
	- Reduced time to decision making
	- E.g. Macys reduced time to reprice 73 million items from 27 hours to one hour
- Create innovative products and services
	- Google creating and killing products quickly
		- RIP Google Reader
	- Zillow’s “Zestimate” 
		- Fancy proprietary algorithm
	- Improve decision making (usually)
		- Better quality data more quickly
			- Assuming the inputs and models are good
### Stages of Big Data Analysis
#### Discovery
- What’s in the data?
- What innovations do the data afford?
- Can the discovery be automated?
	- Automatically seeking correlations
#### Production
- Operationalize and design the promising innovation
- Putting those innovations into production
	- Involving the correct people 
		- Specifically IT people who understand data, management science, and decision making 
	- Type of strategy (McKinsey)
		- Maintain and defend core business
		- Nurture emerging business
		- Create genuinely new business
