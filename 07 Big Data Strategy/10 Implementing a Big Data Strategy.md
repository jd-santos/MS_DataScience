# 10 Implementing a Big Data Strategy
## How to Implement
- Start with the stage model of strategic planning
	- Determine the goals of data initiatives
	- Define the problem
		- Consider external and internal opportunities
	- State the goals and objectives given this problem
	- Determine how the goals will be measured
	- Decide how “success” is determined
- McKinsey Horizons
	1. Maintain and defend core business
	2. Nurture emerging business
	3. Create new business
- After problem definition
	- Determine data sources
	- Figure out how they will be captured
	- What techniques are most appropriate?
	- What do outputs need to look like? 
- After obtaining results
	- They need to communicated with stakeholders and decision makers 
	- Often this step fails 
	- You need to tell a good story that makes sense to them
		- Execs are more likely to believe that they are more skilled and not there due to luck or partial luck

		>> Communicating with executives and upper management is a critical thing for us. It’s important to be able to tell a good story that makes sense to them, as most executives believe they are at the top of the organizational hierarchy primarily because of their own skill rather than luck (or at least partial luck).

	- Change management is critical
		- People resist change so change management is a critical implementation skill
		- Usually this resides with management, but we need to state the results accurately and clearly so change can be managed 

## What to Implement
- Breakthrough innovations are the most rewarding, but also the most difficult and rare
	- Many innovations simply reduce costs or provide marginal improvements on existing services
	- Amazon and UPS made billions by shaving time from business processes
		- Orion system that optimizes driver routes
- Better capture and analysis tools
	- May not be glamorous, but they’re the foundation of the company’s capability
	- However, remember that the value of big data is the product or service that is developed and delivered
		- Nobody cares about your nerdy toys so don’t get distracted and focus on results
- Unstructured data
	- Most of life is unstructured, and better tools for analyzing this type of data are being developed (AI, neural nets, NLP, visual analytics, etc) 
## What Companies Expect
- Increased ROI either through revenue generation or cost reduction
- Increased automation of existing processes to improve productivity
- Product and service innovations
- Tech, methods, and tools that can be embedded into business processes across the organization
- All business initiatives should support human decision maker decisions
- Big data projects need to help everyone make better decisions, that is always the end goal
