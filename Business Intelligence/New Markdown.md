# BI Intro
Hi, I'm JD

I work as a systems analyst in Austin. Business Intelligence analysts make up half my team and my goal for this course is to finally understand what's being said in my meetings, ideally before my coworkers catch on. We use Tableau heavily so I'm happy to see that's part of this course.

Until I update this, I'm still looking for a team. I've taken Dr. Lucus' undergraduate version of this course and escaped without life-threatening injuries if that lends me any credibility. You can stalk my LinkedIn if you like, feel free to send a request.

Good luck and happy new semester,
JD Santos
