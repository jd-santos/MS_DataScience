# Intro to R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document, a format that allows intermingling code with text for the purpose of exporting to other formats such as HTML and Word with the code input and output formatted into a single document.

Insert a code chunk by typing the following, using the Insert GUI in RStudio, or typing CMD-OPT-I on Mac.

```{r include=FALSE}
#Use include=FALSE to hide code chunk from HTML/Word
#Code goes here
#{r} tells the IDE to use R
#The following commands load packages mosaic and tigerstats
require(mosaic)
require(tigerstats)
```

Now that those packages are loaded we can run some statistics.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Use echo=FALSE to hide the code but show the output
favstats(~fastest,data=m111survey)
```

Let's make a density plot of the fastest speed ever driven:
```{r echo=FALSE}
densityplot(~fastest,data=m111survey,
            xlab="fastest speed (mph)",
            main="Fastest Speed Ever Driven")
```

You can run just the chunk your cursor is in by pressing CMD-SHIFT-Enter on Mac. This allows you to check your output in the console before knitting.

Practice adding some other parameters to the code chunk to change the graphic size

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3}
densityplot(~fastest,data=m111survey,
            xlab="fastest speed (mph)",
            main="Fastest Speed Ever Driven")
```
