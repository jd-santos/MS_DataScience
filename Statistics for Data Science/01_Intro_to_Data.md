# Intro to Data
## Organizing Data
Data is a collection of numbers, labels, or symbols with context
- **Data table**
	- Rectangular arrangement of data with rows and columns
	- **Rows:** Observations or cases 
	- **Columns** Common attributes or variables 
	- 
## Types of Datasets
- **Categorical data**
	- Qualitative or nominal variables
	- Represents characteristics of something
	- Identifies group membership
	- Can't do any computation on it, if numbers are used they have no mathematical meaning
	- E.g. brand, type, address
	-**Nominal scale**
		- Name or description that doesn't imply order 
		- E.g. brands, name of a state, gender
	- **Ordinal scale**
		- Categories that can be ordered
		- E.g. 1-5 stars
- **Numerical data**
	- Quantitative or continuous variables
	- Describes the numerical properties of cases
	- The difference between two measurements have mathematical meaning
	- **Interval**
		- Numerical values that can be added or subtracted but have no absolute zero concept
		- E.g. Temperature, test scores
		- Can't multiply or divide 
	- **Ratio**
		- Does have meaningful zero
		- Can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided 
- **Time series**
	- Data recorded over time
	- For prediction or casting
	- **Timeplot**
		- Graph of a time series showing values in chronological order 
	- **Frequency**
		- Regular time spacing of data in a time series (e.g. daily, monthly)
	- **Cross-sectional**
		- Data observed at a point in time
		- 
## Aggregation and Recoding
- Recode 
	- Building a new variable from another variable
	- E.g. recoding a price into expensive or inexpensive
- Aggregate 
	- Reduce rows in a data table by counting or summing values within categories
	- Rolls granular information into bigger views
		- E.g. individual transactions -> revenue
		- "Shortens" or "reduces" data
## Best Practices
- Provide a context for your data
	- Definitions of variables, sampling, etc
- Assign clear names for variables
- Distinguish numerical from categorical data 
	- Statistical programs will struggle distinguishing categorical numbers
- Keep track of the source data 
- Pitfalls
	- Don't assume that a list of numbers is numerical data
	- Don't trust all of the data that you get from the internet 
	- Don't believe every claim based on survey data
