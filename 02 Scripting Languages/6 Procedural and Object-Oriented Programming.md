# Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming
## Overview
- Procedural Programming
	- Writing programs made of functions that perform specific tasks
	- Procedures typically operate on data items that are separate from the procedures
	- Data items commonly passed from one procedure to another
	- Focus
		- To create procedures that operate on program's data 
- Object-Oriented Program
		- Focused on creating objects
			- Object
				- Entity that contains data and procedures
			- Data
				- Known as data attributes and procedures are known as methods 
			- Methods
				- Perform operations on data attributes
		- Encapsulation
			- Combining data and code into a single object
		- Data hiding
			- Object's data attributes are hidden from code outside the object
## Classes
- Class
	- Code that specifies the data attributes and methods of a particular objects
	- Similar to a blueprint 
- Instance
	- An object created from a class
	- Like a specific house built according to blueprint
	- There can be many instances of a class
- Format
	- Starts with capital letter by convention
- **__init__** initializer
	- Used to initialize (assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created
	- Runs as soon as an object of the class is instantiated
- **__str__** string method
	- Returns a string variable of the object's state
	- Invoked with print(object_name)
