## Goals
- Dimension reduction technique 
- Trying to narrow our dataset to fewer variables

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
These are used to describe the shape of multivariate data. Formal definition:
- If A is an n*n matrix, the eigenvalue of A is the scalar (位) provided there is a nonzero vector $\bar{x}$ that allows the following to be true:
  - $A\bar{x} = 位\bar{x}$
  - 位 is the Eigenvalue
    - A scalar that gives us the magnitude of the Eigenvector
  - $\bar{x}$ is the Eigenvector of A corresponding to 位
    - Any nonzero multiple of this matrix is also an Eigenvector of A
