# 8 Big Data and Innovation
## Innovation Approaches
- Innovation: A new idea with its implementation
- Not just a new idea alone 
- Approaches: top-down and bottom-up
### Top-Down Innovation
- Deliberate planning and investment by an organization
	- i.e. from management
- E.g.
	- Canon in the 1980s wanted to develop the first desktop photocopier
	- Netflix’s deliberate strategy to disrupt TV and movies 
- Advantages
	- Usually proactive rather than reactive
	- Better access to resources since management controls them
	- Likely more aligned to company’s strategic goals
- Limitations
	- Management is less likely to understand operation issues
	- “Solutions” may not actually address real problems
	- Opportunities may be missed because management can’t anticipate everything alone
### Bottom-Up Innovation
- Innovation coming from observations rather than planning
	- Problems or opportunities in everyday operations are noticed, typically by employees closer to the “floor”
- Advantages
	- More opportunities can be identified, there are more people 
	- Often more closely aligned to the operational issues and capabilities because that’s where they’re found
	- Most innovation is bottom-up
- Disadvantages
	- Can be difficult to be heard and funded
	- Many of these opportunities may be trivial, filtering and sorting is a difficult task
	- Generally a reactionary approach
### Blended Approach
- Includes aspects of bottom-up and top-down
- Example
	- Google offers 20% of worker time as “creative time” 
	- It’s partially top-down because they aren’t necessarily observations, and partially bottom-up because they aren’t directly about broad strategic initiatives 
 ## Innovation Strategy
 - The Innovator’s Dilemma by C. Christensen
 - Organizations innovate more quickly than people’s needs change
	 - A large number of customers and future customers have more features than they want or need
 - The rational behavior for a firm is to provide these capabilities for their most demanding and profitable customers
	 - They can charge more to maximize profits
	 - This creates the titular dilemma 
 ### The Innovator’s Dilemma
 - The seeming rational behavior of companies creates opportunities for competitors to differentiate themselves on the “simple” end of the market
	 - E.g. Southwest Airlines
 - As competitors take over the low end, established companies retreat further to the high end 
	 - E.g. Full-service international airlines, first class, business class, etc
 - Eventually Competitors begin chipping away at the mid and high ends with their low-cost business
	 - E.g. Southwest is starting to offer more business-class amenities
 - Overcoming the dilemma, the “Innovator’s Solution”
	 - Firms need to disrupt themselves
	 - Best accomplished by using truly autonomous units within the larger organization with adequate resources
	 - Look for ways to address the needs of non-consumers
### Disruptive Innovations
- Usually don’t offer anything new
- Rather, they appeal to new or less-demanding customers by being simpler, more convenient, or less expensive 
- An innovation is disruptive if:
	- It changes the business model of the industry
	- It changes the behaviors or preferences of a large number of consumers 
- Examples
	- Apple: iTunes and the music industry, laptops, etc
	- Email: disrupted the postal service
	- Expedia: travel agents
	- Amazon: retail
	- Zillow: real estate
## Big Data for Innovation
- Examples:
	- Tesla and John Deere use sensors for all equipment which allows for super optimization
	- Uber and Airbnb using digital platform to lower the cost of their respective services in their industries 
	- Google Nest lowering the cost of home automation and operation
	- Location-based services
		- Targeted promotions based on location
		- Traffic data to predict sales
		- Increasing awareness of nearby businesses 
## Innovation Process
- Capture and measure user behaviors to understand opportunities, wants, and needs to create new data 
- Search for patterns and anomalies
- Create new products or services based on insights
- Measure performance to improve monetization or optimize the offering 
- Use feedback data to try new ideas, products, or services

## The bottom line
- Innovation is hard
- Big data presents possibilities for innovation that hasn’t been possible before
- Sustainable innovation is a continuous process
	- Disruptive innovations are likely to occur to every product or service regardless of how innovative they were originally
	- Innovation must be a continuous process to avoid being undercut
	- Requires granting free creative time or utilizing autonomous business units with resources and decision-making power
