# 4 Data Fusion and Integration
We can often create greater value by finding synergistic elements of data to create better products and services
#\## Example: Zillow
- Several data elements have value on their own:
	- Home details, photos, price
	- Maps and street views
	- Tax, crime, schools
	- Recent sales of comparable homes
- Integrated data
	- Comprensive listing
	- ZEstimate
		- Estimate of price based on proprietary algorithm
		- Can be fairly accurate 
	- School rating
	- Walkability score
	- Mortgage info
	- Crime scores
	- Real estate agent ratings
- Allowed for new product offerings
	- "Make Me Move"
		- Service that allows sellers to invite bids without officially listing their houses
		- Sellers can guage potential interest
			- Doesn't start the official listing date timer 
			- Houses lose value as they stay on the market
		- Zillow gets data\
	- "Mortgage Marketplace"
		- A service that matches lenders and borrowers
