# It's ok to be concerned

This article presents a bleak future for the future of our work environments. In the pursuit of infinitely increasing financial efficiencies, we are discussing a level of surveillance that has never been possible in human history. This is a conversation about living in that state of surveillance for the rest of our working lives.

Right now we're all focused on cooking up thoughtful academic responses to this topic, and there has been some sharp analysis on this board today. What I'd like to contribute is a reflection that human lives, including ours, are impacted by the analysis or decisions of professionals in the field of data analytics and IT more broadly. It's easy to churn along developing technology and business solutions without considering the final implications of what we've produced. 

I'll stop pontificating here to suggest you check out Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil. It's a short an informative book about the dangers and weaknesses of approaching data science in careless or presumptive ways. She does a great job highlighting how frequent unintended consequences are easy to arrive at in this field.
