# 6 Human Side of Big Data
## Overview
- People are the key to making DS work
- Data scientists:
	-  Define the problems that will benefit from big data
	-  Design the methods and machines that enable capture and analysis
	-  Design the data to be captured
	-  Make inferences and frame the results for decision makers
-  Davenport book:
	-  “It’s obvious...that the skills of talented human beings are the single most important resource in successfully exploiting big data
## Data Scientist Roles
- Hacker
	- Knowledge of coding and big data tech
- Scientist
	- Approaching problems from exploratory and theoretical points of view
	- Develop hypotheses, design experiments, analyze and summarize the results from the data
- Quantitative Analyst
	- Understands descriptive and inferential statistics
	- Also data visualization, machine learning, and neural nets
- Trusted Adviser
	- Need to communicate results and conclusion from analyses to decision makers
	- Gartner study:
		- Between 70-80% of BI projects fail owing to a combination of poor communications between IT and the business, the failure to ask the right questions, or to consider the real needs of the business
- Business Expert
	- Has a basic grasp of the business, including sources of value, potential competitive advantage, functional and business problems, etc
- Is it more valuable to have someone with deep knowledge in one area of data science or a data science role generalist?
## Vertical vs Horizontal Data Scientists
- Vertical
	- People with deep knowledge in one area
- Horizontal 
	- People with broader but shallower knowledge across the functions of the data scientists 
- Davenport likes the horizontal data scientist more
	- That’s why our MSDS program is set up to support this! 
## Teams and Division of Labor
- Nobody is in expert in all five roles
	- Teams that can leverage combined skill sets of multiple data scientists are usually most effective
- However, normal group work issues are still present
	- E.g. group think, power problems, politics, etc
## Changes in Organizational Decision making
- The volume and velocity require that organizations may need to act with greater uncertainty
- As a result, mistakes are more likely
	- They need to be tolerated
	- Otherwise opportunities may be lost putting the firm at a competitive disadvantage
- Example: social media analytics 
	- Usage patterns and volume, sentiment analysis can impact strategic and operational decisions quickly
	- Slow company may miss opportunities or problems
