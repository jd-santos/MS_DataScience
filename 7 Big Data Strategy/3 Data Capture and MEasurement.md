# 3 Data Capture and Measurement
## Overview
- Data capture can be active or passive
- Active example
	- Getting customer reviews from Yelp
- Passive example
	- Aggregated purchases in a store
	- Web cookies collecting browsing
## Active Data Capture
- A manual data transfor initaited by a decision from a person to transmit the data
- Data transfer is specific and limited 
- Data collection would not occur without the person's voluntary decision
- The provider is in control of the information and is explicitly aware of the sharing
## Passive Data Capture
- Automatic, occurs without human interaction (sort of)
	- It's captured as part of a separate business process where a human may have interacted
- Doesn't need a definite end point or even a defined purpose
- Customers are typically not aware of the data transfer and rarely give permission
- Examples
	- Smartphones
		- Basically everything 
	- Agriculture
		- Sensors in equipment can be used to measure a bunch of things
		- Can help with crop yields, selection, management, etc
	- Healthcare
		- Apps and devices that capture biological data 
		- Can allow health professionals to interevene at more effective times with better techniques 
- Advantages
	- Avoids the Hawthorne Effect of people changing their behavior when they know they're being observed
	- Convenience and efficiency
	- Allows for longitudinal analysis since feedback is recorded regularly and frequently 
	- Difficult to manipulate or game the system
- Disadvantages
	- Privacy concerns
		- Have people really consented to the use of data?
		- Sensitive data might be exploted by the data gatherers
		- Ethics
			- Data collected can be used against us
				- E.g. employment, insurance, credit card apps
			- Should companies be rquired to receive informed consent?
## Active Data Direct Measurement
- Data collection is purposeful and has an established intent
	- Limited to specific variables and focused on specific measures
- Collected at the individual level with the intent of aggregating to the population 
- Example
	- Progressive monitoring driving behavior for lower rates
	- Monsanto and Pioneer using crop seed sales to gauge hybrid demand
## Passive Data Indirect Measurement 
- Examples
	- Smartphone data used to track shopping mall foot traffic
	- ADP payroll data used to guage US employment health
	- Billboards collect passing by smartphone data to inform the owners about frequency of traffic
## Precision in Data
- Precise data used to be difficult to capture, so formerly organizations relied on estimation techniques
	- E.g. coupons with specific bar codes to track advertising campaigns 
- Increases in precision are expected to create greater expectations for customized recommendations by consumers
	- At least that's what the ad industry wants you to believe
- Now precision is more of a science thanks to computing power and smartphones 
	- E.g. GPS data, airplane location, social media marketing 
	- More examles: employers tracking employee computer use, personalized data
