## Repo organization

### Lecture Notes
The top directory in each class will be the course lecture notes, including example code. These are my own annotations and understanding of my professor's notes, and I'm doing my best to ensure copyrighted content doesn't slip through. This is the current working directory for my studying, so feel free to file a bug if something slipped through my .gitignore.

 Otherwise these markdown files were lovingly typed by hand into [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), my favorite Markdown editor.

### Projects and Assignments
These items will always be my work, with the exception of code included as part of the assignment and group projects. Often I try to include some headmatter to explain the task or prompt I am responding to. Feel free to file an issue if you find somewhere where this is not the case. 

### Readings, etc.
Extra content provided by the professor or dug up by me while doing background research. May be in a variety of file types. Hopefully nothing copyrighted, most of these should be from public sources. 

## Formats
Most of descriptive content is in markdown or Jupyter Notebooks (Python and R). There's a possibility I'll migrate the R content to RMD or R-Notebooks, but that's an internet debate I'm not ready to wade into. 

## Cheatsheets
These are my references that I update with useful snippets I've learned that assist my workflow, they aren't necessarily taught in class.
TeX, for example, is not a part of the curriculum but I've found it extremely useful for capturing formulas so I can stay in markdown/notebooks.
