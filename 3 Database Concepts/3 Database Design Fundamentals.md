# 3 Database Design Fundamentals
## Physical Modeling
- After logical modeling, we move to modeling the physical design of our database
	- This now covers topics like table names, column names, and column data types
- Main terms in database modeling have several names
	- Entity, Table, or Relation
		- Relations specifically meet first normal form criteria
	- Attribute, Column, or Field
	- Instance, Row, Tuple, or Record
		- Think of them as instances of an entity
## Moving from logical to physical models
- Entities become tables or relations that are constructed in a Database Management System (DBMS) like MySQL
- Fields become columns or attributes
- Add **Data types**
	- Type of data allowed for each column
	- Must be specified in logical models
	- Example categories
		- String
		- Numeric
		- Data/Time
	- Data types are DBMS specific, refer to documentation to understand what specific types are available
	- We will be using [MySql data types](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/data-types.html) 
-  Table properties
	-  Properties that can be specified for each field besides just the data type
	-  Not NULL
		-  The field must contain a value for every instance/row
	-  Unique
		-  The field must be unique
		-  Useful for primary keys
	-  Auto Increment
		-  The DBMS will automatically increment the value of the field
		-  Often used for surrogate keys 
-  Resolve many-to-many relationships
	-  Usually resolved by creating a new entity/table between the two tables
	-  Use primary keys from both tables to create composite key in the joining table
	-  Extra attributes can be added that provide information for the combination of the two tables

## Database Design Fundamentals
- Database
	- A collection of interrelated, shared, and controlled data
	- Can be processed by one or more application systems
	- A self-describing collection of related records and tables
- Relational database
	- A type of database that stores data in relations (tables)
	- Each relation is composed of tuples (rows/records) and attributes (columns/fields)
	- Data can be structured in an organized way that minimizes redundancy and prevents tables from being out of sync
	- **ACID Compliant**
		- Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
		- Assures all database transactions are reliably processed
		- Prescribes exactly how transactions interact with the database
- Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)
	- Often document rather than table-oriented
		- Single document file vs multiple tables
	- Easier to store unstructured data
	- Generally sacrifice ACID compliance for flexibility and processing speed
