# 5 Introduction to Structured Query Language
## Overview
- SQL 
	- A programming sublanguage designed to manipulate relational databases and the data stored within them
	- Uses simple, declarative statements to do so
- Developed in the late 1970s by the IBM Corporation and was endorsed as a national standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987
- There are different implementations of SQL standard
	- E.g. Microsoft uses Transact SQL, or T-SQL
	- We will use MySQL
## Types of SQL statements
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**
	- Used for querying, inserting, modifying, and deleting data
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**
	- Used for creating tables, relationships, and other structures
- SQL/Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM)
	- Extend SQL by adding procedural programming capabilities, such as variables and control flow statements
	- Provide some programmability within SQL
- Transaction Control Language (TCL)
	- Used to mark transaction boundaries and control transaction behavior
- Data Control Language (DCL)
	- Used to grant database permissions (or revoke them) to users and groups
	- Allows users and groups to perform various operations on the data in the database
