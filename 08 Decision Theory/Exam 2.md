Exam 2 

# 1.
> A college class has 40 students who sit in rows in a tiered classroom. There are five rows in the classroom and where the students sit in the classroom is entirely random. In the third (middle) row of the room one student has his laptop computer open during each class period and surfs the internet rather than paying attention to the professor and class material. He is the only person in the class using any type of electronic device. Following the first exam, the professor noticed that students sitting in the last two rows of the classroom scored on average 20% lower than students sitting in the first two rows. Why would this be? Answer in 100 words or fewer.

The use of electronics in class does not just distract the student using the device, it also distracts students who have a view of their device. Research has shown this to have a measurable affect on test scores.

# 2. 

> Brooke is the exclusive saleswoman for a pharmaceutical product at TLD Corp. She has forecast her sales in units of the product over many years (i.e., some years she forecast sales of 20,000 units, some years 30,000 units, etc.). The graph below illustrates the relationship (the dashed line) between her forecasts and her actual sales. How would you characterize Brooke's forecasts? Why? Do her forecasts need to be improved? If so, what can be done? Answer in 100 words or fewer.

Brooke's forecast are consistently greater than actual sales. This means that her judgements are typically overconfident. Since this is a consistent error, it could be improved by calibrating her forecasts with this information and making less aggressive predictions.

# 3. 
> George is trying to decide how to invest the money he will devote to stock investments this year. He believes the most important event is the performance of the stock market. He has partitioned the stock market returns into four states of nature and has assessed probabilities of those states of nature based on business cycle data. He has selected three different types of stock funds into which he could invest and determined outcomes based on historical data. The outcomes represent returns in thousands of dollars.

George is likely performing a maximin choice rule, meaning he chooses the maximum of minimum values. He choose hedge funds, which is the best choice given the "worst" outcome of stock market losses.

# 4. 
> Patricia was interviewing for a new job recently. Whenever she interviewed she always carried a folder with a pen her father gave her as a college graduation gift. In past interviewing situations Patricia had always carried her pen and had always been offered the job she wanted. Prior to one interview, Patricia opened her folder and her pen was not there. She searched for it but was unable to find it. She felt very nervous about her interview that day and did very poorly during the interview. She was not offered that position, even though it was one she coveted highly. Comment on Patricia's behavior concerning this interview and the most likely cause of her poor performance in 60 words or fewer.

Patricia's pen may not have an effect on the interview itself, but her belief in the "luck" it provides likely influenced her performance. Research has shown that the placebo effect has a measurable effect on outcomes, particularly in high-stress situations such as an interview.

# 5. 

> ABC Corp. was interested in acquiring DFL Corp., as ABC was convinced that DFL could add significantly to its profitability in the long run. ABC made a bid for DFL for $1 billion. Soon after ABC's bid, PDQ Corp., a major competitor of ABC, made a bid for DFL valued at $1.2 billion. ABC wanted to acquire DFL very badly, so it bid $1.4 billion. PDQ raised its bid for DFL to $1.5 billion. ABC now had to decide whether to continue bidding. The highest fair market value for DFL, by ABC's analysts and outside analysts, was $1.5 billion (other analysts valued DFL lower). ABC's board of directors authorized ABC to continue to bid, as the directors did not want to lose DFL to a major competitor. Suppose that ABC and PDQ continued to bid until ABC won the bidding at $2.7 billion. Comment on ABC's behavior in 80 words or fewer.

ABC (and likely PDQ Corp) have fallen into a trap of escalating their commitment beyond the point of rationality. Specifically, they are trapped by the bias of competitive escalation because they are competing on the bid for this company. If either party had tried assuming the position of a neutral decision maker, they might have seen that they are no longer making rational decisions after initially committing to this acquisition.

# 6. 
> Robert and Dennis are brothers who both unexpectedly inherited shares of XYZ Corp. on the same day three years ago from a distant relative they did not know. The price of the shares when they inherited them was $120. Unfortunately, XYZ Corp. has gone through some difficult times recently and the share price is now $80. Both Robert and Dennis need money at the moment for large purchases. Robert refuses to sell because he does not want to experience the loss. Dennis readily sells because he is happy about the gain. Using concepts learned in this course, explain the different reactions of the two men in 100 words or fewer.

The two brothers have a different framing of their inheritance affecting their judgement in different directions. Robert has framed the situation as an overall loss since an earlier sell would have netted him more money than a present sell. Dennis has framed the decision as a net gain, because regardless of fluctuations in share value it is still money that he didn't have before. This difference hinges on their perception of whether the reference is 0 (Dennis) or 120 (Robert) even though the objective amount is the same.

# 7.
> A software development team at RFK Corp. needed to decide between two methods to pursue for designing some new software. (Assume that some of the group members knew each other but that no one on the team was a friend of anyone else.) Both methods were reasonable options and could have been selected. After much deliberation, the ten members of the group voted 6-4 in favor of Method A over Method B. The group then began to discuss Method A and why it would work well. Group members who had voted in favor of Method A emphasized all its benefits. After a while group members who had voted against Method A also began to become enthusiastic about it, contributed to the discussion of the benefits, pointed out the flaws in Method B, and seemed to become happier with Method A as the choice. After the discussion the team leader decided to take another vote to see whether more team members now liked the choice. Suppose that the vote for Method A was now 10-0 in favor. Based on concepts learned in class, speculate on the aspects of group dynamics that may have led to the change in the number of team members favoring Method A, in 80 words or fewer.

This development team appears to be experiencing a classic example of Groupthink, especially along the lines of suppressing dissenting views and confirmation bias. The latter can be found in the group starting to discuss all the benefits of Method A; they only see evidence that supported their decision. This inertia builds with the suppression of dissent, or even false agreement as in the Abilene Paradox if the original dissenting members decide to keep their disagreement private.

# 8. 
> A firefighter arrived at the scene of a fire at a small apartment building and assessed the situation. Within several seconds he made the decision to run inside the building. Three minutes later he emerged carrying an injured elderly man from the building. Twenty seconds after he emerged the building collapsed. How did the firefighter make the decision to enter the building? On what did it depend? Answer in 100 words or fewer.

The firefighter was making a naturalistic decision, which is a System 1 decision likely influenced by his experience and training for these specific types of situations. In this case, there was clearly no time for deliberate decision making and the firefighter needed to rely on his intuition about the state of the building to make the rescue.

# 9.

> Kevin is project manager for a design team that is re-engineering a manufacturing process. The team includes design specialists, information technology personnel, industrial engineers, and organizational psychologists, among others. The team has not worked together in the past. At one point the group faced a difficulty concerning how to manage orders for products. Since no one on the team made any suggestions, Kevin proposed a solution that he selected at random. No one on the team disagreed, so the team adopted the approach. Assume that every team member thought the idea was bad, but no one voiced that opinion. Assume also that the approach was unsuccessful when implemented. What problem in decision making is apparent in this situation? Why? Answer in 40 words or fewer.

This is an example of managing agreement, an issue described by the "Abilene Paradox". By failing to communicate their desires or opinions, they have essentially allowed pure chance to execute a decision on their behalf.

# 10. 

> Ben is a member of a project team for PDQ Corp. He specializes in what is sometimes known in business as a "back office" activity, that is, one that is essential but that is rarely noticed and usually taken for granted. Ben's project manager almost never interacts with Ben and Ben's role in software development projects, although critical to their success, is rarely acknowledged. Recently, Ben has been feeling unappreciated and his performance on his portion of projects has begun to deteriorate. His manager is considering having Ben moved to another project team or suggesting to management that he be fired. Based only on the information given, what is the most likely problem in this situation? What can be done to potentially mitigate or improve it? Answer in 80 words or fewer.

Ben appears to be a victim of the bounded awareness of his manager. The results of work are not immediately obvious to his superiors, and that results in them not taking steps to value his performance. This could also be seen as an availability heuresitic, if Ben or his work is not immediately available in the memories of his manager. 

# 11. 
> Susan makes her own investment decisions for her 401(k) retirement account at her company. She was recently at lunch with one of her friends and the friend asked Susan how her investments had performed last year. Susan told her friend that she had five stocks that had gained more than 30% and that she had been very clever to purchase them when they had been inexpensive. She also mentioned that she had had bad luck with one company’s stock because the company had foolishly moved into a new product line that had failed miserably. She also noted that her one foreign stock holding, a Japanese firm, had not done so well because of the continuing problems with the Japanese stock market. She did not mention the two other stocks she owned that had not done well last year to her friend. From an outsider’s viewpoint, how would you comment on Susan's conversation with her friend?

Susan is demonstrating extreme overconfidence in her descriptions of her investments. She focuses heavily on her successes and overestimates her accuracy in picking them. The failures are either ignored, or ascribed to external failures that couldn't be predicted. Without addressing her biases, it is unlikely she will be a successful investor in the long run.

# 12. 
> It's springtime in the year 2030. You're looking back at the [stock market] crash of 2020, the devastation it dealt your portfolio and how you behaved as an investor.
> What will you say? 
> If human nature is any guide—and, let's face it, it is—your accounts of what happened will begin with such words and phrases as "Clearly…" or "It was obvious to me that…" or "Everybody knew that…"
> In the future, your memory of the crash of 2020 won't be a recollection. It will be a reconstruction, built partly from what is happening now and largely from what you learn later about what hasn't happened yet.
> What is the phenomenon the author is describing? Why is it detrimental to decision making? Answer in 80 words or fewer.

The author is describing hindsight bias, and it diminishes our ability to accurately asses our past investments to make better predictions in the future. It removes our ability to analyze how we react to information because we have a poor memory of what information was actually available to us at the time. 

# 13. 
> An article we read for class discussed the paradox that exists when people in a group take an action that no one in the group privately wanted to take. What is this paradox? Why does it exist? What can be done to prevent it? Answer in 80 words or fewer.

The "Abilene Paradox" describes organizations who pursue an action selected by the members even if they didn't agree with it. This occurs because the members don't voice their disagreement due to anxieties of the perceived risk of doing so.  This can be prevented by creating meeting structures that allow for constructive debates, encouraging dissent, assigning specific people to always dissent, or similar strategies that make employees feel comfortable sharing their opinions.

# 14. 
> Phillip was driving with a friend and discussing a complex topic from his workplace. When they reached their destination, Phillip had to park the car on the street between two other cars (that is, parallel park). Despite the fact that he was not done discussing his workplace topic, he stopped talking while he parked the car, and so did his friend. What is the most likely reason for this behavior? Answer from an information processing perspective in 120 words or fewer.

Phillip is a human with a human brain that has limits to it's processing. In this case, both holding a conversation and parallel parking are activities that require the working memory's focus in order to achieve. The working memory can only perform serial processing on items that are System 2 tasks, so Phillip needs to finish the activity of parking before he can continue conversing. If Phillip were a more practiced driver, it is possible that many aspects of parallel parking could become System 1 activities. Until then, it's good that Phillip has a friend who knows to stop talking when there's a difficult parking job to perform.
